# Bubble Sort Implementation

## Overview

This code provides a skeleton for implementing the **Bubble Sort** algorithm in Java. Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
## Files in the Project

1. **`BubbleSort.java`**:
   - Contains the `BubbleSort` class with a `sort` method (to be implemented) and a helper `swap` method.
   - The `sort` method takes an array of `Comparable` objects and sorts it in ascending order.

2. **`BubbleSortTest.java`**:
   - Contains JUnit test cases to verify the correctness of the `BubbleSort` implementation.
   - Students can run these tests to check if their implementation works as expected.

## How to Complete the Assignment
### Step 1: Fork the repository
### Step 2: Implement the `sort` Method
### Step 3: Run the Tests
### Step 4: Commit your code and submit the url on canvas (make sure your repo is public)
